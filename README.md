# Shop-Shop

## Description
Module 22 homework assignment. Already established e-commerce MERN website that I refactor to better manage the state of the application. I added a shopping cart feature to the site and use IndexedDB to create persistent data after the browser closes or an internet connection is lost. Also implemented the Stripe payment system to process online payments.
